## About The Project
I am a student of the 3rd edition of DevInHouse, this is the first project of the first trimester of the course.
Our objective was to make a to-do-list using HTMl, CSS, JS. 
The requirements were
* A title in the browser tab, so that the user can find your application among the various tabs that it constantly keeps open.
* A header inside the page, so the user can easily know what page they are on and what the content is about.
* A text field to enter the name of a new activity to be added to the list.
* A button to add a new activity to the list.
* A list containing the activities already entered.
* Each line of the list must contain: checkbox for the user to mark that activity has already been performed, 
the text that the user typed when registering the activity, button to delete the activity from the list, if desired.
* When the user marks a task as done, the text on that line must be strikethrough (line-through).
* The list must be saved in the browser's "localStorage" (including which items have already been performed), and must be loaded whenever the page is reopened.
